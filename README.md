# Portfolio18

A port of my personal portfolio website to a more modern configuration:

- A Rails 5.2 app
- using ActiveStorage for image attachments
- serving a GraphQL data api
- consumed by a React frontend web app
- bundled with Webpack/er

And maybe someday:

- consumed by a React Native iOS client
- created with Metro
